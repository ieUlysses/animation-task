This project will be a game style. there will be a form and a table at some point.

The form will act as a betting slip when a person will choose one of thr browsers and also pick a position that the browser will come 1 through 4, collect a price for the bet and also the persons name

The table will display the bet when the race is finished

Using java I would like to have a trigger button for the animation and also an announcement that pops up when the race is over. 

Animation:
    Flourescent glowing sign centered under the h1 above the form

    info box icon that is under feeling lucky in multiplier will grow and show a content box that will act as a legend for the multiplier

    Submit button on form will flash when pressed triggering the race
